To change from main.f90

1) integer, parameter :: KOI_nr = 9
Here you should change the number 9 for the number of stars you have in the file_input_STARS

2)
     double precision, dimension(4), parameter :: LAT = (/-31.5983/)
     double precision, dimension(4), parameter :: LON = (/295.4533/)
     double precision, dimension(4), parameter :: H = (/1350/)

Update to latitude, longitude and altitude of Argentinian observatories Bosque Alegre in Cordoba, and CASLEO in San Juan.

H is in meters, and both latitude and longitude are in degrees. Longitude is measured negative towards west, Argentina for example is around -71, so you can do 360 - 71 and put that number into longitude. But please get the coordinates from google right ;-)


Attached you can find a compressed file with everything you need AND a running example :-)
Test it first with 2 stars because it will take a loooooong time.


Run:
python dates.py
for each one of your found stars. Output files should be called "star.BJD", where "star" is the name of each one of your stars.


Create two files:

file_input_STARS:

This is a file with the name of the files of the stars. Each one should contain the following information:
1   WZ_Pic  5.84   85.304625  -57.44116   9.20   WZ_Pic.BJD

Description:

1: flag, not important, keep it to 1.
2: Name of the star, without white spaces.
3: Eclipse duration in hours.
4: Right ascention in degrees
5: Declination in degrees
6: Magnitude of the star
7: BJD output file name.

The second file should be:
file_input_BJD

Here you should have the names of the .BJDs generated at the beginning.
Once everything is set, you run the main script typing: ./main.sh
