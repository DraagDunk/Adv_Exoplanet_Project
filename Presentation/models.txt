LINEAR MODEL

Planet moves in a straight line in front of the star.
This path is determined by:
 - projected obliquity
 - impact parameter
Not correct!

PHYSICAL MODEL

Planet orbits the star. Kepler's equation is solved for input parameters.
The path is determined by a, e, i, omega, m_*, m_p, t_p, lambda, R_p/R_*, v*sin(i).
Much more ressource heavy, but also correct.
